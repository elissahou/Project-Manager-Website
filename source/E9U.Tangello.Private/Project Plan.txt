E9U.Tangello.Private - Project names manager.

Features:
- Asking for a new project name. (Get any, vs Choose your own?)
- Creating lists of project names, sorted by category.
- Associating name categories with project types.
- (DONE) For used projects, add a description.

- Adding a new project name.
- Viewing project names.
- Managing project names (CRUD on names, CRUD on categories, CRUD on project types).
	- removing a category: removes the category and the mapping and all the project names under the mapping
- Check if a project name has been used.
- Search option (on names and descriptions)

Needs to be implemented (!):
- Forbid adding a duplicate project name. (should be unique across all categories)
- Forbid adding a duplicate category name.
	- on the Forbids: redirect to a page if forbidden action taken.
- Page: view all projects (some simple way to show project name and description, with link to project name?)
- Page: get a project name (shows all categories ???)
- Initialize mapping start/end times. (End date should always be MAX_DATE)

Should be implemented:
- Enter a description when getting a project name.
- When you're on a project names page for a category, it should tell you what project type it's tied to (and give an option to change project type)
- some sort of sort by project type??? view by project type???
- not allow someone to access a link ??????? for example, if a project name belongs to an UNASSIGNED category, you shouldn't be able to access the link
- CRUD on project type: maybe on a page that allows you to view all projects, sorted by type

Problems
- Query string doesn't recognize "#"
-- ex: /ProjectNames?categoryName=#z >> categoryName from query will return null.

Next up:
- project type crud
-- renaming project type: check if it already exists
