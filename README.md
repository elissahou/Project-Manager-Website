# Project Names Manager


Web development practice website.
Manages projects; assigns project names; assigns categories (e.g. colors, drink flavors) to project types (e.g. experimental projects, script projects).  

Ex: assign project type "Script Projects" to category La Croix flavors:
On creation of a script project, automatically generates "Pamplemousse" project name

Practice for Javascript to database communication.  
Practice for CRUD on project names and project description.
